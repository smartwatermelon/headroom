"""Loopback-only access guard for /debug/* endpoints.

Unit 5 of the Codex-proxy resilience plan. A FastAPI dependency that
raises :class:`fastapi.HTTPException` with status 404 — *not* 403 — for
any request whose client address is not the loopback interface. 404 is
deliberate: debug endpoints should be invisible to external scanners,
not merely forbidden.

The guard is a ``Depends(...)``-friendly function (rather than a
middleware) because:

* FastAPI's dependency injection makes the guard explicit on each
  route, so ``ruff``/reviewers can see which endpoints are guarded.
* ``TestClient`` lets us override a dependency with
  ``app.dependency_overrides``, which is the cleanest way to simulate
  a non-loopback client in tests.
* The set of debug endpoints is small and co-located; a middleware
  would be disproportionate.
