# Docker-Native Install

Run Headroom without installing Python or Node.js on the host. The install scripts add a native `headroom` wrapper that keeps **Headroom itself** in Docker while orchestrating the rest of your workflow on the host OS.

## One-line install

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chopratejas/headroom/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chopratejas/headroom/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

## What the installer does

1. Verifies Docker is installed and available.
2. Pulls `ghcr.io/chopratejas/headroom:latest`.
3. Installs a `headroom` wrapper into `~/.local/bin` or `~/bin`.
4. Updates shell startup files so the wrapper directory is on `PATH`.

The wrapper keeps Headroom inside Docker and mounts host state back into the container so native behavior stays consistent:

- project workspace -> `/workspace`
- `~/.headroom`
- `~/.claude`
- `~/.codex`
- `~/.gemini`

Port `8787` stays the default, so `http://localhost:8787` works the same way as a native install.

## How the wrapper behaves

### Native Headroom commands

These run directly inside the container:

```bash
headroom proxy
headroom learn
headroom mcp install
headroom memory list
```

For `proxy`, the wrapper publishes the selected port back to the host:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 8787:8787 \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  -w /workspace \
  ghcr.io/chopratejas/headroom:latest \
  headroom proxy --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8787
```

### `wrap` commands

`wrap` is host-oriented in Docker-native mode:

- the wrapper starts the Headroom proxy in Docker
- container-side prep writes Headroom config, memory, and `rtk` guidance into mounted host files
- the target CLI itself is launched on the host by the wrapper

Supported host wrap flows:

- `headroom wrap claude`
- `headroom wrap codex`
- `headroom wrap aider`
- `headroom wrap cursor`
- `headroom wrap openclaw`
- `headroom unwrap openclaw`

OpenClaw remains host-native in Docker-native mode:

- the host must already have the `openclaw` CLI installed
- `headroom wrap openclaw` installs/configures the Headroom plugin through the host `openclaw` CLI
- plugin auto-start still launches the installed host `headroom` wrapper from `PATH`, which then runs Headroom in Docker
- local plugin source mode (`--plugin-path`) is also supported, but it may require host `npm` when build steps are needed

## Docker Compose support

Use `docker/docker-compose.native.yml` when you want an explicit compose-managed proxy or CLI shell.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
export HEADROOM_HOST_HOME="$HOME"
export HEADROOM_WORKSPACE="$PWD"
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.native.yml up proxy
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
$env:HEADROOM_HOST_HOME = $HOME
$env:HEADROOM_WORKSPACE = (Get-Location).Path
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.native.yml up proxy
```

You can also run one-off CLI commands through compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.native.yml run --rm cli learn
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.native.yml run --rm cli mcp install
```

## Environment passthrough

The wrapper forwards Headroom and provider environment variables into the container, including common prefixes such as:

- `HEADROOM_`
- `ANTHROPIC_`
- `OPENAI_`
- `GEMINI_`
- `AWS_`
- `GOOGLE_` / `GOOGLE_CLOUD_`
- `AZURE_`
- `OTEL_`

That keeps provider auth and runtime config working without maintaining a separate env file for the container.

## Notes

- Docker is the only required Headroom runtime dependency on the host.
- Wrapped tools like Claude Code, Codex CLI, Aider, and Cursor still run on the host when you use `headroom wrap ...`.
- The install scripts are idempotent: rerunning them refreshes the wrapper and image without duplicating shell profile blocks.
